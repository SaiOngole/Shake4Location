Shake4Location
==============

1. An android application that returns the current location when the device is shaken. 

2. Reverse Geo-coding is implemented to get the address from the location co-ordinates.

3. The application saves the values of the co-ordinates on the X,Y and Z axes when the shake is detected.

4. These values are stored in the "values" folder on the SD card.
